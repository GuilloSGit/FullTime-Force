# FullTime Force Challenge

Description: An application that interacts with the GitHub API to display commit history, built using Nest.js + React.

## Objective

The goal of this test is to create an app that displays the git commit history for the public repository associated with this project.

### Technologies Used

```plaintext
    - Frontend: [React] + [TypeScript + SWC]
    - Backend: [NestJS] + [TypeScript ]
    - Deployment: [Railway]
```

You can find documentation on the GitHub API [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

### Requirements

1. **GitHub API Usage:** Utilize the GitHub API to retrieve the git commit history of your project. Avoid using scrapers or alternative methods.

2. **Public Repository:** Create a public GitHub repository for this project. This allows us to review and verify the accuracy of your code. After completing the project, share the repository link with [gap - email address].

3. **Styling:** The page's style is open to your preference. You may use technologies like Tailwind CSS or others commonly used in our projects. Adapt the styling based on business requirements later.

4. **Backend Framework:** Utilize NestJS as the preferred framework for the backend. While you have the option to choose another framework, avoid using Express.

5. **Real-time View:** The page does not require real-time updates. It's acceptable to refresh the page to fetch the latest commits from your repository.

6. **README Instructions:** Provide detailed instructions in the README on how to install and run your project. Failure to include these instructions may result in rejection.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness of the project
- Code Cleanliness
- Technology Assortment
- Software Design
- Testing Implementation
- Quality of Instructions in README
